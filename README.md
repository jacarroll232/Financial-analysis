Stock data with Python


I create a Python script that analyzes the records of stock data to calculate each of the following:


1. The total number of months included in the dataset


2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
